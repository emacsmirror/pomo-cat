* Overview

=pomo-cat.el= is a simple yet charming Pomodoro timer for Emacs.
Unlike many existing Pomodoro packages that rely on notifications,
mode-line displays, or logging, =pomo-cat= places an adorable cat in the center
of your screen during breaks—either as an image or ASCII art.

This playful approach helps you *visually recognize rest periods* and avoid
overworking or skipping breaks due to overlooked alerts or distraction by timers.

* Motivation

Most existing Pomodoro timers for Emacs focus on features like:

- Desktop or mode-line notifications
- Logging work/break times
- Progress indicators

However, in actual use, we found:

- Notifications are easy to miss—especially when deeply focused.
- Mode-line timers divert attention unnecessarily.
- Logs are rarely reviewed.

Hence, the need for a *visually engaging and unmistakable break indicator*.
This package was born to show a cat in the center of the screen during breaks,
reminding you to truly “take a break.”

* Features

- Pomodoro timer with customizable durations
- Displays a centered cat using:
  - An image (on GUI Emacs via `posframe`)
  - ASCII art (on terminal or fallback)
- Supports both short and long breaks
- Lightweight and minimal, no persistent logging

* Installation

Place =pomo-cat.el= in your `load-path`, and add the following to your init file:

#+begin_emacs-lisp
(use-package posframe)
(use-package popon)

(use-package pomo-cat
:vc ( :url "https://github.com/kn66/pomo-cat.el"
:rev :newest))
#+end_emacs-lisp

* Usage

Start the timer:

#+begin_emacs-lisp
M-x pomo-cat-start
#+end_emacs-lisp

Stop the timer and hide the cat:

#+begin_emacs-lisp
M-x pomo-cat-stop
#+end_emacs-lisp

* Customization

Use =M-x customize-group RET pomo-cat RET= or set variables directly:

- `pomo-cat-work-duration-seconds` :: Work session length (default 1500s = 25 min)
- `pomo-cat-break-duration-seconds` :: Short break length (default 300s = 5 min)
- `pomo-cat-long-break-duration-seconds` :: Long break length (default 900s = 15 min)
- `pomo-cat-cycles-before-long-break` :: Number of Pomodoros before a long break
- `pomo-cat-cat-image-path` :: Optional path to a cat image (for GUI Emacs)

* Dependencies

- [[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]] (for GUI popups)
- [[https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-popon][popon]] (for terminal popups)

The package gracefully degrades:
- If `posframe` is not available, ASCII art is shown in message buffer or via `popon`.
- If `popon` is not available, ASCII is printed to minibuffer.
